# CryptoPayAfrica (CPA Coin)
### Bringing Blockchain to Africa since 2018

CryptoPayAfrica aims to be a unified cryptocurrency across the African continent providing a safe, secure and stable method to send and receive money as well as a platform to do business without handling cash. With 1,216 billion people and 54 Countries, Africa is begging for a fast, secure, and affordable payment solution. Our goal is simple… Educate Africa on blockchain.

CPA Coin is built on Cryptonote technology and offer our users the ability to transact absolutely anonymously with no interference from any 3rd parties.
Our currency will be the preferred method of sending money to anyone in Africa and all over the world.
